# Rummy (remote)

Play a game of rummy, but when you're in a different location to your other players!
This is a self-managing solution, you get to create your own games, admit players and approve winners.

This game is early in its development, you need to indicate when you think you've won - the computer doesn't work it out for you.

# Playing

You can [play a game online](https://rummy-remote.azurewebsites.net/).

Enter your name and press Next.

You can choose to start a new game or join an existing game (so long as it hasn't started).

If you start a game, you are responsible for admitting players who join, and starting the game.

# Taking turns

When playing, your hand will be shown towards the top of the page. You can re-arrange them as you see fit.
When it is your turn the background will turn green. The other players are shown above your hand, with the current player highlighted in green.

If you want to take a card from the deck, click on the deck (purple back). Otherwise click on a card to pick it up or put it back.

Tick the option, BEFORE, returning a card to indicate that you've won.
