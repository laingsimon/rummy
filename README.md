# Rummy (remote)

Play a game of rummy, but when you're in a different location to your other players!
This is a self-managing solution, you get to create your own games, admit players and approve winners.

This game is early in its development, you need to indicate when you think you've won - the computer doesn't work it out for you.

# Playing

You can [play a game online](https://rummy-remote.azurewebsites.net/).

Enter your name and press Next.

You can choose to start a new game or join an existing game (so long as it hasn't started).

If you start a game, you are responsible for admitting players who join, and starting the game.

# Taking turns

When playing, your hand will be shown towards the top of the page. You can re-arrange them as you see fit.
When it is your turn the background will turn green. The other players are shown below your hand, with the current player highlighted in green.

If you want to take a card from the deck, drag a card from the deck (purple back). Otherwise drag a face-up card to your hand. Drag the card you want to discard to the face-up pile (to the left of the deck).

If your move leaves you with a winning hand, click the button under the deck. Make sure you discard your card first. The other players will need to review and confirm you have won. Once at least half of the other player agree then everyone's hand will be shown.
